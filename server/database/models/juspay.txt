Here are three **project ideas** that align closely with what Juspay values and will make your profile stand out:

---

## üß© 1. **Mini Payment-Orchestrator with Smart Routing**

* **What:** Simulate a basic payment router that distributes transactions across multiple mock gateways based on success KPIs.
* **Why it matters:** Juspay's‚ÄØopen-source Hyperswitch is precisely a payment orchestrator with Rust backend and React/JS frontend ([reddit.com][1], [arxiv.org][2]).
* **Extra challenge:** Add a simple ML classifier (e.g., Random Forest) to route transactions dynamically‚Äîsimilar to Razorpay‚Äôs AI smart-routing approach .

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **Functional-Programming SDK or UI Micro-App**

* **What:** Build a small UI framework in JavaScript (or PureScript/Haskell) for configurable payment widgets‚Äîmaybe a mini React-like library with functional reactive programming (FRP).
* **Why it matters:** Juspay places heavy emphasis on functional programming for both their SDK and Presto UI framework ([juspay.io][3], [juspay.io][4]).
* **Extra challenge:** Make it modular and hot-swappable, emulating Juspay‚Äôs "Hyper SDK" capabilities ([juspay.io][3]).

---

## üîç 3. **Dashboard for Real-Time Transaction Monitoring & Anomaly Detection**

* **What:** Create a dashboard that ingests simulated transactions and highlights anomalies in throughput, failure-rate spikes, or latency‚Äîusing Grafana-like visuals.
* **Why it matters:** Juspay infrastructure teams emphasize self-healing, anomaly detection, and reliable systems ([reddit.com][5]).
* **Extra challenge:** Integrate ML-based anomaly detection (e.g., unsupervised isolation forest) and alerting.

---

### üöÄ Why These Projects Resonate:

* Showcase **deep functional programming, FP-based architectures**, and UI framework building‚Äîcore to Juspay ([juspay.io][3]).
* Demonstrate understanding of **payment orchestration**, reliability, transaction routing‚ÄîJuspay's bread and butter ([reddit.com][6]).
* Highlight **real-time data, observability, and fault handling**, mirroring Juspay‚Äôs infra culture .
* Allow showcasing system design, ML integration, backend APIs, and clean coding‚Äîall key eval areas during interviews .

---

### ‚úÖ Suggested Approach:

1. Start with a lightweight backend in **Node.js (TypeScript)** or **Rust**, mock 2‚Äì3 payment gateways.
2. Define simple success/failure metrics and implement routing logic.
3. Create a frontend dashboard using React or PureScript for transaction feed and control.
4. Integrate a basic ML model for improving routing decisions or spotting anomalies.
5. Document: architecture, tech decisions, edge cases.
6. Deploy via Docker or cloud demo.

---

### üéØ Final Take

A polished version of **project idea #1 or #2**, combining backend, FP, system design, and a front-end dashboard, will speak directly to the skills, mindset, and technologies that Juspay seeks. It shows initiative, engineering depth, and a mission-aligned project that would capture their attention. Need help getting started? I can assist with architecture or tech choices!
